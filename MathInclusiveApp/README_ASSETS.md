Assets adjustments applied
=========================

What I changed:
- Created `assets/sounds/` and copied/renamed available sound files into it: `correct.mp3`, `incorrect.mp3`, `button.mp3`.
- Created placeholder images in `assets/`: `logo.png`, `avatar-placeholder.png`, `character-square.png`, `medal.png`.

Notes:
- `achievement.mp3` was not available in the source assets, so the `SoundService` treats it as optional.
- If you have higher-quality images/sounds, replace the placeholder files in `MathInclusiveApp/assets/` with the originals (same filenames).
- To run: `cd MathInclusiveApp` then `npm install` and `expo start`.

If something about the assets didn't copy correctly (file listing APIs may not reflect runtime shell copies), run the Windows copy commands in the project root manually.
